Collect Inertial Data using a Hexiwear and Raspberry Pi Zero W!

The goal was to use a local positioning system to help correct for inertial sensor drift to derive the position of a player wearing the device on a soccer field. The local positioning system is currently being designed to use low-cost Raspberry Pi Zero Wireless microcontrollers to listen in on the Bluetooth Advertising of the Hexiwear embedded system on the player. 

As of 06/15/2018, the system logs data, however the Raspberry Pi Zero Wirless Bluetooth anchors are not yet finished.
